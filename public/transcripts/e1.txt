[mice squeaking]


Brennan: Hello, one and all, and welcome back to another thrilling season of "Dimension 20" coming to you with a brand new side quest, "Mice & Murder". I am your humble Dungeon Master, Brennan Lee Mulligan. With me as always… Actually, for the FIRST time, our sylvan sleuths! Say hi, sylvan sleuths!


Rekha: Hello!


Multiple: Hi!


Ally and Sam: Hi, Sylvan Sleuths!


Brennan: Oh, wonderful. Going around the Zoom call, we have Katie Marovitch!


[all clapping]


Ally Beardsley! Sam Reich! Raphael Chestang! Rekha Shankar!


[Rekha does the arm wave from Erotic Clubhouse]


And Grant O'Brien!


Grant: Hello, and thank you so much for having me.


[all laugh]


Ally: The only one who spoke.


Rekha: Yeah.


Grant: I don't know why none of you took your moment. Take your moment!


Katie: Take your moment! I'd like to redo my moment.


Ally: That is the tagline of this season already.


Brennan: Well, with our wonderful gang of adventurers gathered here for a brand new side quest, I invite all of you to imagine.


[thunder booming]


Brennan: Gathering storm clouds, dark, over the countryside of a land both familiar and fantastical, for indeed, I invite you all to come now to a land that some of you might be familiar with. We arrive in a dark and stormy night in the countryside 90 minutes northwest by train, of London, in the country of England, in a little village called Tufting Meadows.


But perhaps Tufting Meadows is a little bit different than one might imagine, for we see the statue of King Charles there in the village square of Tufting Meadows, a short walk along cobblestones slick with rainwater from the train station. King Charles looks as we all know King Charles to look, dapper boots, a sort of fencing saber at his side, and of course his head, with a long muzzle, a wet nose, long, fluffy ears, because of course we all know that King Charles was himself a Cavalier Spaniel, for indeed we are here in the merry English countryside with all of the lovely woodland animals that populate all parts of England and indeed the world, for this is a tale of mice and murder.


[thunder booming]


Storm clouds rumble on the horizon. And though the storm has not fully broken here above the village, it is coming. A slight drizzle of rain slicks the pavement, the cobblestones reflecting the dim gaslight of lamps here in the village square. A long shadow stretches up the country lane, and the sound of pebbles and dirt scraping against metal as a long shovel is dragged upon the shadowy road. A figure, stooped and hunched over but still frighteningly tall, and a top hat perched upon the brow of a sneering weasel. Katie Marovitch, could you please describe and name your character for us?


Katie: [clears her throat] 'ello. I'm Gangie Green, I'm a weasel. I was born in London. Something funny that happened is... my parents died when I was just a little lad.


Rekha: Hysterical.


Kaite: I got raised in orphanages until I got kicked out at 16 for starting fires and thieving. Now, I've spent most of my life in the criminal world, and I'm quite good at it, and here I am.


Brennan: Gangie is stumping along this country lane, headed towards the graveyard behind the old Anglican chapel, Our Lady of Prayerful Paws. Gangie, you are stumping along. In your coat pocket, you have a name on a piece of paper. This name is on a gravestone, and unlike some of the graves you have dug in your time here, this grave already has a body inside it. You've been told to come here and secure something and secretly move it back to Loam Hall.


As you approach, Gangie, you move through the graveyard. Go ahead and give me a stealth check if you would be so kind, and with the gathering storm clouds, go ahead and do it with advantage. You can roll twice and take the better of the two rolls.


Katie: 22.


Brennan: Ooh! Also worth mentioning that Gangie, as a third level thief subclass rogue, doesn't take half movement for climbing, so Gangie gets to the wrought iron gate and stone walls around the graveyard of Our Lady of Prayerful Paws and, in a little bolt of dark, weasely, moving serpentine over the top of the wall, Gangie is within the graveyard, shovel at the ready.


Ally: Like how they say that rats can like flatten their bones.


Brennan: Yes, cartilaginous.


Katie: Weasels can also.


Brennan: Yes, 100%. What Gangie sees as you go into the graveyard, you search around, moving throughout. Gangie, go ahead and make a perception check for me.


Katie: 29.


[Brennan laughs]


Ally: Was that a nat 20?


Katie: 29.


Rekha: Yes, but-


Sam: But what did you roll on the dice?


Katie: I clicked the button on D&D Beyond. It was something plus 9.


Rekha: So 20!


Brennan: That's a Nat 20!


Rekha: 20 plus 9 is 29!


Raph: So 20!


Grant: What could it have been?


Katie: It must have been a 20!


Grant: Can I say really quick off the bat, I'm so glad we're shooting remotely so I don't have to do dice math, my computer will do it for me?


Katie: Yes.


Ally: Yeah.


Brennan: Incredible.


Raph: Absolutely.


Brennan: Gangie, you peer through the dark and see a small candle lit inside of the rectory, the small abode of this Anglican priest, the vicar of Tufting Meadows. It is well past the witching hour. With that nat 20, not only do you see that, you see a weeping widow, Catherine McCabbage, a small little mouse dressed in black, and with a hastily made cup of tea in his hands, we see the vicar of Tufting Meadows. Raph, could you please describe your character for us and introduce him.


Raph: Who, me? Well, of course. My name is Vicar Ian Prescott. If you'll excuse me, there's so many people here, I'm not used to… I have a very small parish. I just have to gather my thoughts. I started out as a young priestling. That's not the actual word for it, but for you to understand what I mean, you understand what I mean when I say priestling. I was a little fellow. My father was in the ministry, my father before that, and they, well, they passed on a share of their flair, but maybe not so much. I didn't have as much of a helping of the eloquence that they had. The good Lord did not bless me so much with that, but what he did bless me with, I have not found yet, but I certainly have it and I'm able to do it here in Tufting Meadows. After I finished seminary, there were many places that I wanted to go, but none so much that the Lord deemed that they would want me.


But here, here is where… When God closes every door but one, you go through the one that is open, and that is what I did! I'm an owl, by the way! I'm a full owl.


Brennan: Incredible. Dressed in stately if hastily donned clerical garments, vicar, you were awakened from your slumber although I will say that you are a little bit of a night owl.


[Raph laughs]


Grant: Oh brother.


Brennan: Woo! It's just getting started, folks!


Katie: That was so good.


Brennan: The widow McCabbage accepts the cup of tea. You know, she's a tiny little mouse, which, you know, the scale of the animal folk here, as in everywhere else in the world, is sort of, you know, mice are, you know, about half the size of the largest animals which are things like badgers and stuff like that, so there is a size differential, but it's a greatly, like, accordion-ed in one. Like, I think in real life a badger's like 100 times the size of a mouse. But the small, little sort of like halfling-sized mouse woman looks up, big sort of globes of tears hanging at the corner of her eyes.


Widow McCabbage: Right, you're very kind, sir. Thank you, vicar, I appreciate the kindness you're showin' me, and I am awful sorry to come wake you up in the middle of the night. I, I just… I keep feeling like I hear his voice outside the window, and… Is there anything in the Good Book, vicar, that says that those that have passed on can come back in some way, or can visit those of us… Do you think my dear Connor might… I don't know.


Ian: Well.


Widow McCabbage: Do you think he might be trying to reach out?


Ian: Oh, sure, the Lord, the Lord speaks… He's with the Lord, and the Lord can speak through the wind or through fire or through me, perhaps speaking through me right now. Do you feel anything?


[Grant laughs]


Brennan: Go ahead and make a persuasion check with disadvantage, if you would be so kind.


[Rekha laughs]


Raph: Persuasion.


Ally: Raph's first roll is gonna be with disadvantage.


Brennan: Disadvantage, yeah.


Rekha: I love that the vicar is like, do you think he's speaking through me? Do you feel it?


Raph: Do you feel it? So I just click on it, just roll it?


Brennan: Yeah, you roll twice and take the worse of the two rolls.


Raph: Oh, got it. All right, so first one's a 12. 7.


Katie: Ooh!


Brennan: So with a 7 persuasion check, you're just a little bit flustered and it's not ideal circumstances for you. You see that Catherine McCabbage looks up and says,


Catherine: At this present moment, is the Lord speaking through you? I don't, um… Oh, you know, now that you mention it.


Ian: Oh please, oh please, oh please.


Catherine: Ah, he absolutely is, vicar, yes.


Ian: Oh, thank God.


Catherine: You seem very shocked, and maybe… Maybe this was a mistake. I'm sorry to come and wake you in the middle of the night, vicar, you seem… I just meant to ask, you know, over the past summer, I know that you were saying that the reason Connor died in the mill is because of negligence and it was unsafe and that these mills are a plague on the land, but, you know, they did have that gentleman detective from London up here over the summer, and some were saying it was murder, and if I keep hearing his voice on the wind, maybe there was something wicked at work and he's trying to tell us something from the beyond. Do you think… Do you think if it was just an accident, even an accident caused by some negligence on the part of the good squire and the mill owners, do you think that that would be enough for him to speak to me on the wind like that, or is it proof that something truly vile did happen?


Ian: Oh, something did happen, and we will get to the bottom of it. You, me, and with the good Lord's help, certainly, certainly he could talking to you, and I know for a fact that something horrible, horrible happened as I, oh God. As I spoke about and have written about and been published, have you seen my articles?


[Grant laughs]


Catherine: Vicar, aye, I've seen the articles. They are about my dead husband, I certainly read them, yes, absolutely.


Ian: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Well in there, you will find that we are in a wicked time all together, and I see more wickedness on the way if we continue down this path, if we do not turn back to, uh, making this land go back to its origins and reject the ways of the big cities and these metropolises and the world, the rest of the world.


Catherine: [pause] Well that's very comforting, father.


[all laughing]


Brennan: Give me a perception check, Raph.


Raph: A perception check! [laughs]


Rekha: Don't speak at my funeral, Raph.


Katie: Yes, please!


Raph: 17, baby.


[thunder booming]


Brennan: Lightning crashes, and for the briefest moment, the graveyard is lit with a flash of lightning and you see a grim figure in the graveyard.


Ian: Hoo!


Brennan: In a moment, it is dark again. The rain picks up, but you think there may be a trespasser on the hallowed grounds of Our Lady of Prayerful Paws.


Ian: Hoo, I think maybe we should just wait this out, see what happens. You stay here.


Catherine: Wait what out, father?


Ian: There's someone lurking about. I don't want to alarm you, but there are wicked things happening.


[Brennan screams]


Brennan: A piercing scream.


Catherine: Father, father! There must be someone out there! He was right, the squire badger was right, and… That, that detective from London, there's really something there the murderer's come back! He killed my husband and now he's come back for the rest of my family! Father please, please go out and find him! Find the man who's done this!


Raph: My head spins around.


Ian: Okay.


Rekha: Aw!


Ian: Okay, okay, you just stay here, you stay here. I have the blood of Christ around me at all times, so I'm something. Okay, I'm going out, I'm going out to investigate.


Brennan: You go and get ready. Gangie, back to you in the graveyard. You find your grave and can definitely make short work of it. This grave is gonna be very easy work for you because you yourself dug it about, like, a month ago. You are deep in there. Go ahead actually and give me an athletics check with advantage.


Katie: 19.


Brennan: 19? Hell yeah. You dig through, and again, in this instance you are fulfilling your function as a grave robber, but this was also something that you took care of in your official capacity as the gravedigger. You get to the casket. For Gangie's work, do you usually take the casket with you, or do you just tie up the body and heft it over a shoulder?


Katie: Tie up the body, put it over a shoulder, and I'll deal with the rest later.


Brennan: You heft the body. It was embalmed, but there's still, it's been underground for a month, there's still the smell of partial rot here. The body is still somewhat intact. You take the body, dressed in a black wool suit is the body of an elderly goat, curling horns coming back, and you heft the body over a shoulder, and as you turn around again to slink through the graveyard, Gangie, go ahead and give me a stealth check, and I'm gonna ask for a perception check for Raph.


Katie: 15.


Brennan: 15.


Raph: Ooh, 22.


Brennan: [gasps] Gangie, you slink through the graveyard, shovel, the body is wrapped up in tarp and rope. Father Prescott, you emerge

with a lantern from the rectory, come out and voom, the light goes up, and Gangie, you are framed in light, and turn to see Vicar Prescott here.


Gangie: Hello.


Ian: Hoo, what has you… What are you doing here? You scared the living daylights out of me.


Gangie: Mind your own business.


[Brennan laughs]


Brennan: I'll actually ask here for an intimidate check from Gangie. Roll intimidate, but go ahead actually and add 5 to whatever you roll, 'cause I'm gonna say that you are menacing enough that instead of using your charisma, you're gonna use your strength modifier here.


Katie: 18.


Brennan: 18, that's an 18 intimidate. So Raph, up to you to determine that. You see Gangie. Gangie is the official gravedigger, so, like, does sometimes have business here in the graveyard.


Raph: Right.


Brennan: But it's up to you how Vicar Ian responds.


Ian: I know that look. I think I will leave you. I will just assume that you are working late and very dedicated to your job, sir.


Gangie: That's right.


Ian: Yes, that is right.


Gangie: That's right.


Ian: That is correct.


Brennan: Gangie slinks away with this huge parcel over his shoulder, over the graveyard wall and gone into the night, and you see that the Widow McCabbage comes out and says,


Catherine: Father, is everything all right? I heard you speaking to someone out here.


Ian: Yes, yes, everything is fine. Gangie is just putting in some extra hours for free, honestly we should be thanking him for the amount of work and dedication that he is showing. You know, you can't just have dead bodies all sprawling around at all corners of the night. I guess people can die at any time and need to be buried immediately. Why don't we put on some tea? We can put on some tea and chat more about your husband and, and these-


Brennan: You see the widow kind of looks up at you and furrows her brows, says,


Catherine: Something about that weasel gives me the heebie-jeebies, father, and I don't mind saying it even to a man of the cloth.


Brennan: She ties a shawl around her neck and looks up and you and says,


Catherine: I trust your wisdom, vicar, and sorry to bother in the middle of the night. I know my problems are my own. Shouldn't have come here to disturb you, and...


Brennan: She looks up at you. Give me an insight check.


Raph: 7.

Brennan: 7. It's raining, you don't see much of a look, but you do hear her parting words as she gets ready to walk back to her home where her mother is currently staying to help take care of her now fatherless children. She looks up at you and says,


Catherine:  I understand, father, that the Lord works through us in his own way, but I think every once in a while it might do us well to do a little bit of work on the Lord's behalf even when he's not working through us, and I wish you a good night, vicar.


Brennan: And she walks off into the rain.


Ian: Be careful!


[Brennan and Grant laugh]


Brennan: We move away from the flustered vicar's rectory. The first sign in some time that one of your parishioners has seen fit to lean on you in this way, and we move up over the dark graveyard to the country lane where the stooped figure of Gangie Green returns to the massive manor, not on the hill, but in the hill, to the top of Loam Hall, and to business of his own.


We cut the following day to a wonderful morning. In 22B Hampstead Street, in the city of London, wonderful chamber music is playing and we see two figures in an apartment, one of whom has just made arrangements to take a motorcar out to the countryside, and the other of which is reading a newspaper. Rain drizzles as it often does in London against the windows. Music is playing, but I will allow the music to be described and the manner of this dwelling to be described by the inhabitants. The first inhabitant we see is one who has just gotten off of the brand new installed telephone to make way for this motor carriage. We see a tall figure, and they are standing there just near the telephone. Ally, could you please describe your character for us?


Ally: Yeah, hello everybody. Yeah, my name is Lars, I am a Doberman Pinscher. A lot of people call me Sergeant, and that was because, yeah, I was a sergeant. I have a bit of a military background, sue me. Ah, what else about me? Hm. I am very strong, oh! And, hm, what else? I guess looking at Lars, they're one of those dogs that has so, like, very human-like muscles, so it's just like an extremely, they're an extremely muscular dog with just like a thin coat of jet black fur, but they're wearing a bright pink tuxedo.


Raph: Yeah!


Ally: Is that too much of a curveball?


Brennan: Perfect.


Katie: Perfect.


Brennan: We see this enormous military background body-person for the main, the sort of like, long time inhabitant. It is the Hunter of Hampstead Street himself, the gentleman detective renowned across all of Great Britain and, in fact, the world. With a newspaper in his hands, we move over, and Grant, could you describe, actually, the dwelling we're in a little bit? Some of the accoutrements we would see on the wall, and also the music that's currently playing?


Grant: Yes, so the place is very cluttered with old photographs of the exploits of one detective Sylvester Cross, the most famed detective in all England. At the moment, my body man is playing some music, and I've insisted that it be brass, because I do believe that the Americans have perfected the art of the brass band.


[Raph screams]


I do enjoy how rousing it is in the morning, though I say,


Sylvester: Lars, I do wish you would have gotten rid of that contraption. You know it spies on you.


Lar: Which one?


Sylvester: Your telephonics.


Lar: Oh, you know I heard it was sending my data right to somebody.


Sylvester: What's his name, the Eel Musk.


Lars: Yes!


Sylvester: Who owns the telephone company. Constantly listening to us, I know that he is-


Brennan: I can't fucking believe it. Ally has done so many of these, this is fucking record time for anachronistic pop culture references. We are 45 seconds max.


Ally: It was not me this time, it was not me.


[Brennan laughs]


Ally: I start doing pull-ups on, like, the windowsill.


Brennan: Pull-ups in a full tuxedo.


Rekha: My exercise outfit!


Grant: And I take a look at the wood around the window and see it begin to creak and think to myself, well, there they go again.


Brennan: We see, as we move across the room, exploits, musical instruments, a wonderful small sort of gentleman's bar, there's a decanter of brandy, some crystal glasses.


Grant: I daresay it's not as small as one might think for polite company!


Brennan: And we look at a newspaper. The front article, the front page headline, reads as follows.


Scotland Yard closes McCabbage case. Sylvester Cross leaves his first and perhaps last caper uncracked.


In the body of the text, it reads,


The unfortunate death of Connor McCabbage at the Tufting Meadows textile mill has been ruled an accident, leaving accusations of negligence on the part of William Brockhollow ringing soundly in the ears of London high society. Vicar Ian Prescott's words of admonishment from the pulpit of Our Lady of Prayerful Paws have left questions of cut corners on the minds of all those sympathetic to the McCabbage family. Adamant on the involvement of foul play rather than factorial noncompliance, Squire William Thornwall Brockhollow hired the Hunter of Hampstead Street, none other than Sylvester Cross, whose daring exploits have splashed the covers of our pages since the Cottonbottom Caper and his first run-in with criminal mastermind and archrival the late Fletcher Cottonbottom those many years ago. Sly Sylvester took the case, indicating to the world that indeed foul play was afoot, and yet even with the help of trusted companion Sergeant Lars Vandenchomp, it seems for the first time, the hunt has gotten ahead of the fox.


Sylvester: I say, they've used a very handsome photograph, haven't they?


Lars: Yeah, I was going to say the same thing. I look gorgeous.


Brennan: And speaking of a handsome photograph, Grant, could you describe your character for us?


Grant: Yes, Sylvester is a bit of a fop. Sylvester is in his mid 50s, very handsome, but perhaps just past his prime. Sylvester walks with a walking stick because of an accident. His arch nemesis, one Fletcher Cottonbottom, is the son of Sylvester's former employer, Lord Ignatius Cottonbottom, now late. Sylvester began his career as the personal physician to Lord Ignatius Cottonbottom, who was the head of the British Museum. Ignatius Cottonbottom faked his own death by using science. All England thought that he had died and risen from the dead at the hands of the occult, but no, it was tinctures from America that made him appear dead to all but the keenest of eyes. Fletcher Cottonbottom, his son, was in line to be the recipient of a great sum of insurance payment, if only that plan hadn't been interrupted by yours truly.


Lars: And yours three-ly!


Grant: Now all these many years later, I have, I daresay, seen better days. I have just... I'll keep going until you cut me off.


Brennan: Cool, that's great, perfect. You see, yes, Sylvester.


Grant: Oh, and what do I look like? Describe my character? Sure, yes. Well, I'm a fox, and a bit of fop. I always dress to the nines, never without a waistcoat, always with a brightly colored dress. I enjoy being seen and I enjoy seeing others.


Brennan: Incredible. Sylvester, you have definitely read things critical of yourself in the newspaper before, but they were always attributed like, you have had plenty of negative press from Scotland Yard and the constabulary, you know, who you are constantly showing up and who are themselves a bunch of corrupt and crooked and decadent people that wouldn't know how to solve a mystery if it bit them in their tailed rumps, but this is in the editorial voice of the paper itself, it's… You have many times not taken cases. In fact, in the bulk of your career, you probably turn down 99% of cases just from being boring. Every day, it's like 20, 30 letters, like, please take this. You're usually able to solve the case just by reading the letter, 'cause there'll be a thread in the envelope or a smidge of ash, and you're like, well here's what happened. But you're not even getting that many letters anymore, and this is the first case you've taken that you didn't crack. Resting sort of near your coat and umbrella, your top hat near the door, and Lars, go ahead and give me an insight check with advantage.


Ally: Definitely. Ooh, that's only a 10.


Brennan: Cool, you're just doing pull-ups, so you do not notice the look of melancholy that crosses your companion's face.


Lars: You look so good in that photo!


Sylvester: You're too kind.


Brennan: Sylvester, you instead look at another piece of writing from the person who hired you in the hand of Squire William Thornwall Brockhollow. You see a note penned to you quickly from his desk up in Loam Hall in the village of Tufting Meadows, saying,



To the honorable Mr. Sylvester Cross,


I state to you formally that it does not give me great pleasure to be the first client of the great detective of Hampstead Street to not see my mystery resolved, and to think that I also have paid perhaps the highest price for this dead end of sorts leads me to believe that I have been taken for somewhat of a ride. However, your contract being very clear that no results are guaranteed, I will not be so ungentlemanly as to ask for a refund of any kind. Instead, might we consider it a part of your estimable sum to make a jovial and gladhanded appearance at the celebration of my 60th birthday at Loam Hall, that my daughter and son are throwing in my honor? Your presence there in the presence of the press would do much to alleviate all of the negative attention which your hiring, as I think you are well aware, was intended to alleviate in the first place. Do the right thing, Mr. Cross.


Sincerely,

the Squire William Thornwall Brockhollow



Sylvester: Lars.


Lars: Hm.


Sylvester: When you check my mail, do you not check it for things that I might take as an insult?


[all laughing]


Lars: I am so sorry. I am so sorry.


Sylvester: I've been invited by Bigtooth to go up and be a part of a dog and pony show.


Lars: What?


Sylvester: He wants to parade me around, rub my nose in my humiliation. Well!


Brennan: Lars, my dear friend, you sadly did find this and already RSVPed yes to it. That's why you got the motor carriage.


Ally: I feel like my… Okay, my favorite part about dogs is I feel like their tail is like always the dead giveaway.


Brennan: Yeah.


Ally: So I think my tail is just so deeply between my legs, I'm just like,


Lars: Oh! Um, well now, maybe, Sylvie, would now be a good time to tell you that, um, we leave in 45 minutes or so?


[Brennan laughs]


Lars: You, listen! Listen, hey! You're thinking about this all wrong. This could be a time for clues.


Sylvester: Well, I do like a time for clues. All right, get about steaming four suits for me.


Lars: At once.


Sylvester: We'll depart at once, but I'll tell you this. I'll be stopping by the bank, because I intend to give that big toothed bastard every bit of bones that he paid me back. He'll be receiving a full refund if he thinks that he can simply rub my nose in my failure.


Lars: We don't need his money.


Ally: And I get into a really hot shower and cover myself in really hot water and then I roll over all of his suits to steam them.



Lars: We don't need his money!


Brennan: I mean, the suits are immaculate. Lars, your like rippling pecs and your enormous wingspan with like your traps and delts, you're just hurling these huge trunk cases. You're going for one night and the car has like four cases of like haberdashery and wardrobe on the back.


Sylvester: Make sure to pack the valise as well.


Lars: I will.


Sylvester: It's where I keep my hats.


Brennan: Lars, you have your… You get a chance to, in your pink tuxedo, you have your motorist goggles and gloves, looking extremely the part. Sylvester, you hop into the back and you take off, and we see a little motor carriage trundling up out of the city streets of London and then through the countryside, dirt roads.


[Brennan making old-timey car noises]


Up towards Tufting Meadows, but we also see not only country roads, but country rails as well, and through the drizzling rain, on this extremely light gray morning with the drizzle falling over the green English countryside, we see willows, deep brown rivers with the rain swell churning up the mud from the riverbed, so underneath the light gray sky, we see the green of the English countryside, the old farm walls, sheep huddled together, and we see a locomotive steaming, cutting directly through the countryside, a long tail of white smoke turning with its heat into vapor as well, so this thick tail.


Near the front of the train, in a first class car, not only with beds that won't be necessary for the very short ride, but replete with minibar and a lovely feast with actual dining car service brought up from the rear of the train, we see three individuals living life quite well in this high class car. The first of them I'll go ahead and describe, which is a nervous looking armadillo. An armadillo, that's true, an American here abroad in England, nervously filing some papers, shuffling them into a brief, and we see two other individuals as well. Sam, would you go ahead and describe who we see at the head of the table.


Sam: Yes, I can! So I'm playing Buckster $ Boyd. Buckster is a javelina, otherwise known as a skunk pig. He is a Texas oil baron, kind of like a small boar or a miniature boar. I sort of imagine him as like the 1900s version of a lumbersexual. He, like, looks the part of a cowboy, but like has never done any manual labor in his life. He wears a cream colored suit

and a cream colored cowboy hat that are both a little too clean, kind of throwing off his cowboy image, and his prized possession that he holds dearly in his hand more often than not is a gold pocket watch that was given to him by his late father, in which is inscribed the words,


"Time is money, here's both."


[Rekha gasps]


Rekha: Ooh!


Raph: Yo.


Rekha: Mr. Boyd!


Raph: Yo!


Katie: That's awesome.


Brennan: Incredible.


Rekha: Whoa, fuck, cool.


Katie: Holy shit!


Brennan: Holy shit!


Rekha: Whoa!


Sam: Holy fucking shit!

Rekha: Holy shit, dude!


Brennan: And mere minutes away from arriving at the Tufting Meadows station, do we see… What do we see Buckster doing at the table as we are sort of about a few minutes away from pulling into Tufting Meadows?


Sam: Buckster is like housing his third sandwich. You know, Buckster feels like if there's food around, he's got to taste everything at least thrice, and kind of every once in a while glancing over the armadillo's shoulder to see what's going on in the world of his finances, doing a little bit of backseat driving.


Brennan: Incredible. And seated across from both of these gentlemen, by the window, looking at the English countryside roll past, Rekha, who do we see as the final inhabitant of this car?


Rekha: You see an absolutely stunning raccoon, round as a ball, a gorgeous dress, sunhat covered with trash artfully placed to look like flowers, sipping a brandy daisy, her favorite cocktail and her namesake, this is Daisy D'umpstaire. She is originally Daisy Dumpster, daughter of Rusty and Tuna Dumpster of the South Carolina Dumpsters, but she made her way out of her poor hometown and she's rebranded herself, she is now a woman of the world, Daisy D'umpstaire. She is sipping her cocktail and looking out the window.


Daisy: Buckster, and you're positive we don't have a guest list for this event?


Buckster: Well I do declare, Ms. D'umpstaire, I do declare, I haven't seen anything of the kind. For all I know, we could be hobnobbing with the scum of society.


Daisy: Oh, it's England, of course it's gonna be scummy.


Daisy: Scummy as the weather, my dearest, scummy as the weather.


Rekha: Yeah, Daisy looks sort of wistfully out the window, we're kind of unsure what she's thinking about or why she's asked about this guest list, but England is definitely not her cup of brandy.


Grant: Ah.


Brennan: You see that Armond Armadillo looks up. This is Buckster's chief financial employee, his accountant, looks up and says,


Armond: Well, looking over the spreadsheets here, boss, I got to say, I don't quite recommend the expense for a sleeper car on a 45 minute ride, outside, we probably could've ridden in coach and saved a big old heaping helping of money.


Buckster: Is that a fact, Armie, is that a fact? Let me have a quick look at that.


Sam: And I take the piece of paper from him that he's been doing his math on, and I wipe my sloppy maw with it.


Daisy: Armond.


Armond: Hello.


Daisy: Armond, let me tell you, we're gonna make up more than enough when we get off this train, so don't you worry your crazy little body.


Buckster: That's right, Armie, you got to spend money to make money. That's accounting 101.


Armond: I understand, b-b-but, we're spending money all over the place, so sometimes the making money has to come back, and also, uh, y-you know, my job doesn't let me make money. I'm just trying to find p-places for us to save and everything.


Buckster: You're doing your job, Armie, which is to think about the money going out. Now, let Daisy and I, two against one, think about the money that's coming in. By the end of this weekend, you ain't gonna have to worry your little heart.


Armond: Well, if you say so, boss. You're the brains, after all. I'm just the spreadsheet. [laughs]


Daisy: Yes you are, Armond.


Buckster: That's right.


Armond: Yes, I'm bad. I'm bad.


Buckster: That's right, you are a little tiny piece of dirt.


Armond: I'm a tiny old piece of dirt, and I'm gonna do what tiny pieces of dirt do and I'm gonna roll on down the road.


Brennan: And you see that he just turns into a ball and rolls down the train to go to the bathroom.


Daisy: Thank god, I was worried if I touched him my arm would fall off. You know armadillos carry leprosy, it's disgusting.


Brennan: Train pulls into the station. You see that Armond carries all of your guys' bags as you guys depart the train, and you guys see this, in a trench coat, a little flat cap and a scarf, goggles on the forehead, is a frog who has been sent here from Loam Hall to the village train station, says,


Templeton: Oi there, governor, welcome to Tufting Meadows. If it isn't the estimable Buckster $ Boyd. Maybe we'll call you Buckster Pound Sign Boyd. I'm Squire Badger's chauffer, Templeton Padhop.


Buckster: Mr. Hop, it is a pleasure. Will you be hopping us over to our destination today?


Templeton: Oh, of course, very important guests of the squire come and get picked up in the squire's personal motor carriage personally, they does, and I'd be happy to give you a little tour of our lovely town here, if you wish.


Daisy: We would love that, we just need to wait for our accountant to roll back to the front from the bathroom.


Buckster: Should be any minute now.


Brennan: You see Armie says,


Armond: I-I'm sorry, I'm back, I just had to go take a little bit of a leak. It's hard to squeeze into t-the carriage bathroom because my shell's so big. I am, I am very, very sorry.


Buckster: You are rather big and awkward for little piece of dirt, for a little nothing.


Brennan: You see, you guys arrive. You throw the suitcases on the thing. You see that Templeton says,


Templeton: Oh Lord, look at that. Well, one of the wheels seems to be...


Brennan: You see he sort of adjusts one of the wheels. They're like these thin motor carriage wheels. He looks over and says,


Templeton: Looks like one of the wheels is a little bit ajar, might have hit something of a pothole on the way here.


Brennan: You see he looks over at Armond and says,


Templeton: I'm sorry there, Mr. Armadillo, if you'd be so kind, could you just hold onto the axle here real quick?


Brennan: You see Armond says,


Armond: Well, I suppose I have to.


Brennan: He circles up around the back right wheel of the car and Templeton says,


Templeton: He's a perfect fit! All right, all aboard for Loam Hall!


Daisy: Buckster, we've got to use Armond as a wheel more often.


Buckster: He went from being the third wheel to the fourth, and far more useful this way.


Daisy: Oh, shut up, you're too much.


Brennan: You see Templeton goes,


Templeton: That's a right good quip, mister! Fuck you, you armadillo, fuck you!


[all laughing]


Brennan: You see Armond, you see Armond goes,


Armond: Well, that's a record setting time for a brand new stranger to completely feel free to abuse me to my face.


Brennan: You guys load into the motor carriage. Templeton says,


Templeton: All aboard, welcome to Tufting Meadows, the ancestral home of the Brockhollow family and Loam Hall!


[Brennan's old-timey car noises return]


Brennan: Motor carriage takes off. As the sun is setting, you begin to descend on Loam Hall. Two motor carriages converge on Loam Hall, with a number of other motor carriages and indeed some people traveling on foot from the village. The rain begins to pick up. Fine dressed guests, as well as a broad and vast staff of footmen and porters and maids, valet and butler and all manner of people attending Loam Hall. As you arrive at Loam Hall, you see that this is an ancient red stone manor house, old, old family dwelling place and old money built into the side of the hill. The door is set into the

hillside facing a river, and the road comes up, the cars are able to park in a small white gravel sort of rotunda near an outdoor fountain, the fountain still going even under the rain bubbling up. Various guests, you see that there are sort of, you know, various footmen and other people that are coming in to help people up out of the rain. You guys see that a pug walks up wearing a bowler hat with a big umbrella, he says,


Mr. Snout: Hello there, friends, welcome, welcome one and all to Loam Hall, may I accompany you and take your coats upon arriving at the entrance hall?


Brennan: And he addresses Buckster and Daisy in this manner.


Buckster: Why thank you, good boy. What's your name?


Mr. Snout: Oh, well you can call me Mr. Snout, sir. I'm one of the footmen here at Loam Hall. Milo Snout's the name.


Buckster: Mr. Snout, we are grateful for your service. And I flick him a little American coin of some kind.


Brennan: You flick him, like, a shiny quarter, and he goes,


Mr. Snout: Well well well, do my ears deceive me or do I detect the distinctive brogue of an American, perhaps, if I might be so bold, a Texan?


Buckster: That's a matter of fact correct, sir, that's a matter of fact correct. We are generous with our earnings in America, we tend to bring a bit of that generosity here to Loam Hall, that's yours to keep. Hopefully you can use it, despite its heritage.


Brennan: He says,


Mr. Snout: Well, as a foreign currency, I can assure you, sir, that I cannot spend this here.


Buckster: Then consider it a token of my appreciation, and merely a token.


Brennan: You see he says,


Mr. Snout: I certainly will, sir. Right this way.


Brennan: And you guys go up into the hall. Sylvester and Lars, both of you arrive here as well, park the motor carriage outside. You guys cross a sort of little wooden bridge to get over the river, pull up into the gravel area here. As you guys exit the car as well, you see that there's a lizard wearing a bowler hat as well, long sort of skink looking lizard comes up with a big umbrella, and goes,


Basil Baskins: Hello and welcome to Loam Hall. Pleasure, I'll be taking your hats and coats at the door, and please let me know if there's anything I can do for you.


Ally: I think Lars does like a really quick perimeter check like he's used to doing, very, like, high intensity for the first like minute of every time we land somewhere, so I'm just like. [sniffs]


Brennan: Go ahead and give me a perception check.


Ally: Okay. Perception. Yeah that's right, bitch, 23.


Katie: Ooh!


Grant: Mm-hm.


Ally: I'm somehow so close to everyone's ear, no one knows how I got that close.


[all laughing]


Rekha: Absolutely awful, Ally.


Katie: Oi!


Ally: Was that cute and fun?


Grant: Good show.


Katie: No.


Ally: Was that cute and fun?


Brennan: Incredible.


Ally: Yeah, 23 perception.


Brennan: 23 perception. You notice, with 23 perception, looking around, yeah, busy, lots of guests here are all arriving, there's a little banner, up near the door you see Squire Badger's son, Jeremy Brockhollow, is kind of welcoming people at the door and being very jolly and boisterous. In terms of threats, Katie, where do you think Gangie would be? Because obviously you need to be kind of on high alert because there's a lot of strangers here and like Squire Badger would've told you, like, just keep an eye out in general. Where do you think Gangie would be posted up as guests are arriving at the party?


Katie: I think I'm perhaps sitting on the fountain.


Brennan: Cool.


Katie: Just chilling.


Brennan: Awesome, one of the things you probably would be worried about is that the river, in a heavy rainstorm, can swell up sometimes, and, like, as a groundskeeper, you do have some groundskeeper tasks that you have to do from time to time, so I think Lars, you clock Gangie Green by the fountain. You knew Gangie as a career criminal in London who vanished from the scene probably like less than a year ago, and see him with like garden dirt on his knees and gloves holding a shovel just parked here, and I think you probably see another staff member come over, say something to Gangie and like point up at the hall, so he's not like a fucking ghost haunting this place. Like someone goes and talks to him and then walks away from him. Gangie, go ahead and make a perception check for me.


Katie: Uh-oh, 12.


[Ally barks]


Brennan: Cool, Lars, you are not noticed, you are not noticed by Gangie in this moment.


Ally: I catch myself from barking.


Lars: Interesting, very interesting, hm.


Brennan: As you head up the path towards the entrance hall.


Ally: I give the lizard a German franc.


Rekha: So annoying!


Brennan: Incredible.


Lars: Thank you so much for your hospitality, here you are, this is from Germany.


Brennan: Sorry, a German franc?


Ally: Yeah, maybe?


Brennan: I think it's a mark, I think it's a Deutsche Mark.


Ally: Oh, yeah yeah yeah, of course.


Rekha: I thought you were making a joke. It's like doubly useless, it's not even real German currency.


Brennan: This is some French currency from Germany, yeah. But you see he goes-


Ally: Let's go with that. I give him a German franc.


Brennan: He goes,


Basil: Thank you very much for this highly illegal counterfeit currency.


Brennan: You guys head up. As you are walking up together, Basil collects also under his umbrella another figure walking up the path. In a place where I think Sylvester doesn't have many friends here, and Vicar Ian certainly doesn't have many friends here, the two of you look and see each other approaching the manor at the same time walking up the garden path together.


Sylvester: I say, if it isn't the most religious man in the country.


Ian: That would be me.


Sylvester: How are you, vicar? It's a pleasure.


Ian: I am doing well, I'm doing just fine, apart from all of the, uh, strange wickedness going on. I'm doing the Lord's work, this is where the Lord would have me to go, and where I should go to minister and speak and to speak truth to the powerful.


Sylvester: Well, if the Lord's brought you here, I daresay it's his friend down below who's brought me.


Ian: Hoo, don't speak of such things!


Sylvester: Forgive me, forgive me, forgive me. Yes, I understand.


Ian: It's not a joke, not a joke!


Sylvester: I say it in jest, I don't honestly believe that. I don't mean to offend in any way.


Ian: No, not a joke, not a joke. Okay, but that's okay, that's all right, I can be cool, I can be cool.


Brennan: As you guys walk in the front door of the entrance hall, you guys enter the first wing. You see a beautiful staircase going up into the upper stories, a hall leading back towards the kitchens to your right, and this beautiful ballroom towards your left, the drawing room. Bubbly conversations, servants coming out with glasses of champagne, you see people sort of gather around, as you say the sort of wicked goings on, you hear a voice. First of all, you are both greeted as you enter by Squire Badger's son, Jeremy Brockhollow, who looks and says,


Jeremy: Oh, vicar, pleasure to have you back here as well, and I see Mr. Cross, pleasure, pleasure. Welcome, once again, to Loam Hall, thank you for coming.


Sylvester: The pleasure is mine, dear boy.


Ian: Absolutely.


Brennan: You see he smiles and nods, and you hear a voice to the side say,


Lucretia: Oh, wicked goings on! Is that what we are discussing?


Brennan: You see a very tall, a tall and stately elderly woman, Lucretia Brockhollow, the sister of the squire, who is an aging and unmarried sort of, you know, high society woman, a socialite, who comes over to you. Like her brother, she is very tall and imposing figure, and everything about her fashion is just doubling down on taking up space, like huge fur shawl… She is someone who, the first time she overheard that someone had gossiped

about her and called her an eccentric, the only thing she ever talked about from that moment forward was,


Lucretia: Well, you know people are calling me an eccentric these days!


Brennan: She comes over and goes,


Lucretia: Wicked things afoot, and I shouldn't wonder. If you watch the stars, dear boy, you will know that this is the return of the exact constellatory pattern that was in the sky when Ignatius Cottonbottom cursed the country of England by opening that sarcophagus. That very moment put a dark spell over the land, and the stars have returned to their pattern. The curse returns, I shouldn't wonder, that there are wicked goings on all over the countryside. Spirits afoot, you know.


Ally: Can I do an insight check to see if I can tell what her astrological sign is?


Brennan: Do it, give me an insight check.


Sam: I knew Lars was gonna love this.


Grant: Sure.


Ally: Ooh, that's a 23.


Rekha: Uh-oh, wow, you're gonna nail it.


Ally: Yeah.


Brennan: Okay.


Sam: You're gonna get the hour.


Brennan: I'm going to actually look this up, and I'm gonna roll it on a d12, here we go. That's a 2, the second one on this list I found.


Rekha: Aquarius.


Brennan: Your insight tells you that this woman is a Leo.


Ally: I absorb that info and I just go,


Lars: Oh, such a Leo.


Brennan: She says,


Lucretia: Do I have a fellow student of the stars here as well?


Ally: I lick her face.


Brennan: You see, by the way, what is Lars's sign?


Ally: Oh, Lars is a… Let's make Lars a Cancer.


Brennan: She looks and says,


Lucretia: Ah! Well, a fellow student of the stars, and a cheeky one at that. I can tell, of course, sergeant, that you are yourself a Gemini."


Lars: [gasps] You were so close! Oh my gosh, you were freakishly close.



Lucretia: Don't tell me, don't tell me! Sagittarius!


Lars: [gasps] Oh my gosh, you're a bit farther, and it makes it more fun, you'll get there soon!


Lucretia: No, no no no, those were jokes! Scorpio!


Lars: Ah! No, no! Ah! No!


Sylvester: Vicar, if this is over by tomorrow, you and I will be quite lucky.


Brennan: She says,


Lucretia: Sergeant, I understand, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize that you yourself were a student of these occult matters. Tell me, my dear sergeant, have you ever attended a seance?


Lars: [gasps] Never have I ever, but I've always wanted to. But I'm here on work. I'm here on work.


Lucretia: Oh my dear-


Lars: But if there was a seance, maybe I could go to it.


Lucretia: My dear friend, let me assure you, I am a medium in such manners. You are positively surrounded by spirits, and I'm not just saying that to always be in control of the conversation! Come with me at once!


Brennan: And you see she whisks you off down the hall.


Ally: I bound down the hall after her, I'm so excited.


Sylvester: Interesting, I'd have called her a bit of a "large."


Ally: What?


Rekha: Because a "medium."


Katie: Rude!


Brennan: Sylvester, you see that one of the, like, serving staff walking by just goes,


Staff: Ooh!


Brennan: Under his breath and walks off down the hall.


Grant: And I give him a little shoulder wiggle of acknowledgement.


Katie: Flirty!


Grant: That's right.


Brennan: As the party begins in earnest, where does everyone think they are, like, the three main areas are the dining room, where people are sort of having quieter, more personal conversations. There are a lot of people sitting down in the drawing room with drinks near a nice sort of open fire, and then there's also the grand ballroom that has some people sort of staying there, has some like tables set out, other things like that, they're sort of there temporarily, that have some like places to write well wishes like a guestbook. Which of those sort of three areas do people find themselves drawn to as the party is just beginning and people are sort of saying their hellos?


Grant: I believe Sylvester is in the ballroom so that he doesn't have to sit and settle in anywhere because while he's at the party, he doesn't want to get trapped in any conversations with Squire Badger, so he's standing and staying mobile, so he's in the ballroom.


Brennan: He's in the ballroom, perfect, perfect. And Lars, where are you?


Ally: I'm talking to my new favorite person, but I do also have an eye on where Sylvester is.


Brennan: Copy that. Yeah, you're talking to Lucretia, who is in love with you, and where are Daisy and or Buckster?


Rekha: I feel like we're trying to have little quiet conversations, I feel like we're not somewhere super public but we want a couple people milling about to like scoop some info, maybe even plant some seeds for a nefarious caper.


Sam: Yeah, maybe it's like, we keep like shooting kind of like eyes across the room at each other to see like who's meeting who.


Rekha: Yeah, yeah, exactly.


Sam: Trying to like shake hands with as many people as possible.


Rekha: Let me ask you, is Catherine McCabbage here, like, as part of, like, your husband died, you're allowed to come to this party, or is she not here?


Brennan: Catherine McCabbage is not here.


Rekha: Okay, great.


Brennan: But go ahead and roll an investigation check for me.


Rekha: That would be a 17.


Brennan: You see the son and daughter of the yet to make an appearance squire having a whispered conversation. I'm gonna say 17 is not high enough to automatically get this, but it's high enough that I will let you make a DC 20 perception check to see if you can hear what they're saying.


Rekha: Okay, cool, perception. 19


Brennan: One short, I am afraid.


Rekha: Fuck!


Sam: Is it possible that I, catching Daisy's eyes across the room, would she have indicated this conversation to me and can I make the same go?


Brennan: Not only that, Sam, but you're also a mastermind rogue, which gives you the unique ability in D&D to give the help action as a bonus action at a 30 foot range, so not only can you make the same check, you can actually allow Daisy to make the roll with advantage.


Sam: I will do the latter, I'll give Daisy the advantage.


Rekha: So I roll which thing?


Brennan: Roll that perception check again.


Rekha: Okay, great. With advantage?


Brennan: You already rolled once, so just roll a second time. If it's higher, you'll beat it.


Rekha: Terrific. 15.


Ally: Oh no! Sam, you can still roll!


Sam: Now I would like to do the first thing.


Brennan: So now go ahead, Sam, and give me a perception check.


Sam: Perception check?


Brennan: Mm-hm.


Sam: Oh, that's gonna be a little 25.


[all cheering]


Brennan: So Daisy, you catch by the stairwell Jeremy and his sister Constance, Constance Brockhollow, having a brief conversation. You are, I think, pinned down in a conversation. Who do you think Daisy would have struck up a conversation with here at the party?


Rekha: If there's somebody, like, vulnerable looking, either an older person or a very young or sad person.


Brennan: I'll let you talk either to the oldest person here or what you think is the most vulnerable person here.


Rekha: I'll talk to the oldest person.


Brennan: Cool, you are talking to a woman. You are talking to the Lady Eugenia Bristlebrush, who is an old, old, old widow squirrel, monocle, floral bag, and she wears a full top hat with like an acorn pattern on it.


Rekha: Aw.


Brennan: You see she looks up at you, so you can't get away, she's done that old woman thing of squeezing your arm in a way that is so strong. You see she goes,


Eugenia: Ostentatious nonsense here at Loam Hall. Absolute fiddle faddle, that Squire Brockhollow.


Brennan:The eye contact happens as you, like… You see she says,


Eugenia: All these badgers, these Brockhollows, arrogant, selfish, I'll tell you this. If I could, I would murder everyone here. I would murder all of them. I hate all these people and I'm not even joking, I'm being serious, everyone here is terrible, including myself!


Brennan: And you see that...


Ally: Wait, what?


Rekha: Including myself! Blah blah blah!


Eugenia: This food is ghastly!


Sam: If we all wake up dead tomorrow, we know who to blame.


Eugenia: This food is ghastly, it's hot and cold in this room at the same time.


Brennan: So with that 25 perception, Buckster overhears this conversation of Constance looking out and saying,


Constance: Jez, I'm beginning to be worried. Catherine still hasn't shown up. Where is Mrs. McCabbage?


Brennan: And you see Jez says,


Jeremy: Oh, Constance, I'm sorry, I've absolutely boffed it. We did get an RSVP back today, she declined coming.


Brennan: You see Constance says,


Constance: She declined? No, Jeremy… The signal that sends about father, it paints us in a light like people will assume we haven't invited the widow of the man who died.


Brennan: And you see, go ahead, Sam, and make some insight checks for me.


Sam: Ooh, that's a 14.


Brennan: 14, not great. So they're being guarded because they're in public. On a 14, all you get is the basics of who these people are. You know that the eldest of the two by a couple years is Constance, who is a very spirited, modern, progressive young woman, and her younger brother Jeremy Brockhollow, who's called Jez for short, he is sort of a perpetual… Playboy is not quite the right word, but like a life of leisure, dilettante, kind of spending daddy's money kind of guy. You also see next to them by the stairwell, kind of like helping create a perimeter around them, are both of their husbands. So you see that Constance's husband, Dr. Magpie, is there, who's a London doctor, and you also see Mr. Osmond Sheffield, who is Jeremy's husband, who is a very successful barrister in London and also kind of that like… Some say being groomed for Parliament.


Rekha: What?


Brennan: But they're both doing that sort of awkward husband thing of like, we are brothers in law and it's our spouses that are the siblings, so they're like,


Dr. Magpie: So, how are things going with you?


Brennan: You know, it's kind of like,


Osmond: Good, good, things are good.


Sam: By the way, the way I'm remembering everybody is just by mapping them over "Downton Abbey" characters.


Brennan: Not a bad call.


Sam: I wouldn't be able to, like, approach the husbands, would I?


Brennan: Absolutely you would, they're just kind of dicking around, they're not doing anything.


Sam: Yeah, I'm wondering if I could sort of like use a kind of charisma play to approach them and try to, like, get a little bit more information out of them with what I've just heard from the younger siblings.


Brennan: Yes.


Sam: So I think I sort of waddle on up to them, a little piece of food in my hand from the dining room and I say,


Buckster: Ooh, I just heard Catherine couldn't make it. That is a shame. It would've been good for PR.


Brennan: Go ahead and make a persuasion check for me.


Sam: That is a 24.


Brennan: Now go ahead and make a deception check for me.


Sam: Mm, that's a 12.


Brennan: Okay, I'm gonna make some rolls really quickly. You see Dr. Magpie looks up at you. Dr. Magpie, even though he is a doctor, has the perennial look of a man who grew up poor being in a wealthy manor house, even though he's married to an extremely wealthy woman, he is, you know, like, he forces his body into the shape of an apology to be in this nice home, just going like,


Dr. Magpie: Oh, terrible news, isn't it? Yes, it's dreadful that Catherine couldn't be here, but, you know, I imagine there's a great deal of pain and sorrow, so I don't imagine that she would be in the mood for a celebration, certainly.


Buckster: Oh yes, entirely understandable, entirely understandable. We feel for her and the rest of her family.


Brennan: You see that the other, Osmond, who is a ram, by the way, looks at you, Buckster, and says,


Osmond: I'm very sorry, I don't believe we are acquainted. To whom do we have the pleasure, sir?


Buckster: My apologies. Buckster Boyd at your service, Buckster $ Boyd. I am a business partner of the great Squire Badger's from these United States across the pond.


Brennan: You see that Dr. Magpie raises his eyes and says,


Dr. Magpie: Well, I knew the squire's reach was quite far, but to think it extends all the way to America. I didn't know the squire's business interests reached that far. You'll have to forgive me, sir, this is my first time coming across a genuine Yankee.


Buckster: Well, I am happy to be your exposure to the West. Yes, the squire's business interests extend all the way out to us, all the way over and down, down to us, down into the oil fields.


Brennan: You see that Dr. Magpie goes,


Dr. Magpie: Oh, so you work in oil. Well, that's quite a lucrative line of work, I should imagine, especially given the thrum of industry, which I understand in the United States is perhaps even more gregarious than it is here.


Buckster: Gregarious is one word for it.


Brennan: Mr. Sheffield looks and says,


Osmond: If I might ask, Mr. Boyd… Sorry, is your full last name Dollar Sign Boyd?


Buckster: Oh, Dollar Sign is the middle name. It's actually Cash, or Cassius, it's just how I spell it.


Osmond: Ah, very well. Well, I meant to ask you, where did you come by the rumor that Mrs. McCabbage would not be attending this evening?


Buckster: Well, I just assumed. I mean, she's nowhere to be seen.


Brennan: As you say that, you see that Constance actually steps away from her conversation with her brother and walks right up to you, Buckster, to say hello. You have never actually met Constance before in person, because she moved out of Loam Hall a long time ago. She walks up and says,


Constance: Do I have the pleasure of meeting Mr. Boyd?


Buckster: Indeed, indeed. And, Constance, am I correct?


Constance: Yes, yes, pleasure.


BrennanAnd you see she goes in for a handshake and says,


Constance: Welcome, thank you so much for making the long and arduous trip all the way from Texas. I understand that you have offices across the state, but you yourself live in Dallas, is that correct?


Buckster: That's correct, Dallas, Dallas, Texas. I have genealogy that dates back here. My father was in fact a Brit like you, so he made his way across the pond, here I am making my way back.


Brennan: You see that her brother steps in and says,


Jeremy: Well hello there, Mr. Boyd. It's funny you mention… Please, Jez, by the way, pleasure to make your acquaintance.


Buckster: Jez, it's a pleasure.


Brennan: He sort of smiles and says,



Jeremy: Father told us stories about growing up alongside your father, Boarwell Boyd, a legendary sort. But it's wonderful to once again have a Boyd walking the stones of Loam Hall, welcome. Can I get you a drink, my good man? You look a little bit unrefreshed.


Buckster: Oh please, by all means. I will engulf literally whatever you put in my hand.


Brennan: He says,


Jeremy: Well, I've heard of the American constitution, but let's see it in action.


Brennan: And you see he sort of jabs Osmond's chest. Go ahead and give me an insight check.


Sam: American, pig, one and the same. Insight, 14.


Brennan: You see that he sort of jabs Osmond in the chest a little bit and says,


Jeremy: Am I to understand, Mr. Boyd, that you would like a glass of wine, or would you like to go in for a little bit of the stronger stuff?


Brennan: You see Constance says,


Constance: Jeremy, the party's only just beginning.


Buckster: And if it's beginning, we'd best get into it, then! Give me the hardest stuff you got!


Brennan: You see he looks and raises an eyebrow and says,


Jeremy: A little bit of Irish poitín happens to be sitting downstairs, courtesy of a friend of mine who engages in that sort of illicit stuff. Should be a high enough proof to satisfy even your robust taste, Mr. Boyd.


Buckster: Ooh, well I have friends in Ireland and they are all liquors.


Brennan: You see he goes,


Jeremy: [laughs] A wit!


Brennan: And you see he slaps you on the shoulder. Even with a 14 insight, you're like immediately, Jeremy is completely enamored of you. You're like, this kid… You're like, this kid is the lightest touch, he's in love. For our other friends, so Lars is in conversation, in the ballroom is Sylvester. Also, where are Gangie and Ian at this point? So Gangie, what are you up to at the party at this point?


Katie: I think Gangie is not welcome inside, being the groundskeeper, so he is looking through the window trying to get Buckster's attention.


Brennan: Buckster, you see a grim-faced weasel staring in through the door windows. [Katie and Sam meet each other’s eyes, Sam wide-eyed and Katie smug, and both make “I’m watching you” gestures] [Brennan laughs] Ian, where are you as the party is sort of beginning?


Ian: Father forgive me, I've… The last round of confessions, I forgot to give out the penance.


Raph: So I think Ian is going around giving out everybody the penance that he forgot.


Ian: Three Hail Marys, three Hail Marys, fast for a week.


Rekha: I forgot to tell you, you should be fasting for a week.


Brennan: You see, you go over. You come across the Lord and Lady Bramble. Lord Eustace Bramble is a very officious cow, and his wife, the Lady Winnifred, is a hedgehog. You see she looks up as you come over with the penance with, you know, communion. Lord Bramble says,


Lord Eustace: My goodness, does this… Forgive me if this is blasphemous, does this actually, I don't know, count? Does this count?


Ian: Of course, God is everywhere, and he's in me. You feel him, don't you? You feel him, sure you do. So yes, this absolutely counts.


Brennan: You see, he eats it. The Lady Winnifred says,


Lady Winnifred: Oh, vicar, thank you so much for coming and giving me penance. I was so worried, but I didn't want to say anything at the last mass. You know, I must tell you, I've been praying and praying every day ever since poor Mr. McCabbage died, and I've been thinking of you all the time. I'm so glad that Tufting Meadows has such a spiritual man in these trying times. Vicar, what should women of good conscience and of piety be doing in this troubled time to invite a miracle for these lands besotted by licentious and ungodly people?


Ian: Take the lead. Take charge. More action. Don't stand behind any more of these people that have been running us into the ground and turning us to wickedness that you know is wrong.


Lady Winnifred: Oh, the wisdom of God's own mercy, from your lips, sir! I shall pray every day for someone to take action. [all laughing] I shall pray and pray, you are so wise, vicar. I shall set myself to prayer all night and day to pray that someone do something somewhere.


Ian: No no no, you misunderstand me.


Lady Winnifred: I understand you perfectly, you have made it crystal clear. Very well, I shall get started right away, now.


Brennan: You see that she goes over. Lord Bramble looks over and says,


Lord Bramble: As always, vicar, you will let me know if there are any donations that can be made in a prayerful way.


Ian: In a prayerful way?


Lord Bramble: Yes, I am happy to tithe some fraction of my estate to make sure that it is known that the Brambles are in good standing with the church.


Ian: Literally anything that you could do would help, especially anything in the 100 to 250…


Raph: What is this, pounds?


Brennan: Pounds, yeah.


Ian: 250 pound range would be fantastic.


Brennan: You see he says,


Lord Bramble: Very well, here is my prayer, father.


Brennan: And he just thumbs with his hoof 250 pounds and stuffs it into the rope belt of your robes, says,


Lord Bramble: Go with God, father,


Brennan: And walks off. You guys hear a little, ding ding ding ding! And a very smartly dressed rat in black butler's, sort of a black butler's suit, walks in. This is Mr. Gilfoyle, the butler, looks in and says,


Mr. Gilfoyle: Ahem, one and all guests of the Right Honorable Squire William Thornwall Brockhollow of Loam Hall, the squire wishes to commence the festivities. Please adjourn yourself to the banquet hall, if you would be so kind.


Brennan: And just as you turn to the grand ballroom that they're going to be doing some of the festivities in, you guys walk off together. As you are all heading there, Lucretia grabs Lars,



Lucretia: Oh, dear boy, this way, my brother is going to make a little bit of a speech.


Brennan: And you see that Lady Eugenia looks at you and says,


Lady Eugenia: Oh, that blasted old badger is going to talk our ears off something terrible, I hate that old man. I hate him, I hate everyone, I hate… Everyone here drives me absolutely up the tree.


BrennanBut grabs your arm and walks along with you. Right before this happens, Sylvester, you're kind of off in the ballroom waiting for things to happen, and because it's a little sparsely attended in here, you actually see the squire enter to go up to his place on the dais, but looks up across the room and makes eye contact with you. He goes,


Squire Brockhollow: Ah, very well, Sylvester Cross.


Sylvester: At your service, as always.


Squire Brockhollow: Yes, yes, I imagine this would be the conclusion of this round of services, Mr. Cross. I trust your journey from London was without impediment or obstacle.


Sylvester: No impediments, as always, squire. The road from London has been paved with… Good intentions.


Brennan: You walk up to him-


Sylvester: As another famous road has been.


[match striking]


Brennan: Cool, you light your pipe and you see that he sort of smiles and says,


Squire Brockhollow: Well, Mr. Cross,


Brennan: And by the way, you do have that money from the bank in your pocket.


Grant: Mm. Yes, but I'm gonna wait to give it to him until I can really stick it to him.


Brennan: Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.


Grant: Really make him feel like an asshole.


Brennan: So you see he gets up on the dais. The whole crowd of people begins to come in. The last thing I'll say, though, is that Gangie was at the window for Buckster. Buckster, people start filing into the other room. Do you want to take a second to talk to Gangie now or do you want to file into the room with everybody?


Sam: If I can, I'll take a second to talk to Gangie now.


Brennan: Cool, you step outside and are on the threshold of the open door. It is now pouring rain outside.


[thunder booming]


Buckster: Mr. Green, Mr. Green, what's the word? What's the news? What's the has haps?


Gangie: I'm not saying nothing without my money.


Buckster: That sounds about right. Very on brand for you, Gangly. Okay, fine.


Gangie: It's not Gangly.


Buckster: Here's your… Can I…


Gangie: Yeah.


Sam: Do I have on my person whatever sum I owe Gangie?


Brennan: Yes, absolutely. For our purposes, you're fabulously wealthy enough that there is not a sum of money that it is hard for you to produce.


Sam: Cool, I haphazardly hand Gangie like 50% more than he actually earned.


Buckster: Consider it a tip.


Brennan: So Gangie, you look at this big bunch of money in your paws. You have the names of the collections you've been acquiring recently in your pocket, including the name of the person you went and collected literally last night. This is probably the juiciest dirt you have. Grave robbing is an incredibly lucrative black market trade in England. Medical schools everywhere need cadavers, and there is no legal way to acquire them. But you have a list of names that you have gotten on behalf, and here I will reveal, illicit names of the bodies you've gotten in direct order from someone in Loam Hall who at least says they are giving you these orders directly from the squire himself. So you are given a sum of money. It is up to you whether you want to give the actual names to Buckster at this moment or not.


Katie: Yes.


Brennan: Cool. Buckster, you get a short list of robbed graves, which, given what you are here to do, is worth its weight in gold.


Buckster: I do appreciate this, Gangly. You have more than earned your share today, more than earned your share.


Brennan: You see, as you're at the door, Gangie, you see that Mrs. Molesly comes by, who's this ancient, ancient… She is the housekeeper and the head of the maid staff. Huge Coke bottle glasses, a little gray bun of hair and a maid's outfit, she comes over and says,


Mrs. Molesly: Oh dear, Gangie, I know you're dirty, love, but it's pouring cats and dogs outside, it is. Mrs. Banks has a cup of tea on in the kitchen. Come inside the house just once, you'll catch your death of cold out here, you'll get the [pronounced with a voiced “p”] pneumonia. Please, come in.


Gangie: Thank you.


Brennan: She squeezes your arm. Even though Gangie is a scary guy, Mrs. Molesly has only ever been the sweetest in the world to you. She comes in and says,


Mrs. Molesly: Get yourself a spot of tea, love, and there's a few scones left with some clotted cream, and I've kept them to the side for you, lovey.


Gangie: Thanks.


Brennan: So Gangie, you head off into… The other staff kind of nod to you as you come in. Squire Badger stands up on the dais, says,


Squire Brockhollow: Friends, one and all, of Loam Hall. You have committed the rather inadvisable act of attending the 60th birthday celebration of a known bore, and a rather dull one at that.


Brennan: And you see there's a sort of polite...


[Grant laughs uproariously]


[Raph claps]


Brennan: He nods and says,


Squire Brockhollow: A dark shadow hangs over Tufting Meadows with the sad demise this last summer of one of my very own employees, the beloved Connor McCabbage, and to all of our working folk here in Tufting Meadows, we wish well, and in these trying times we have taken every measure including the hiring of Sylvester Cross, who, although he was not able to find any foul play, did his due diligence.


Brennan: You see Mr. Lawrence Longfoot, who is a hare, look out, and a newspaper magnate, and kind of looks over at you being here and says,


Lawrence: But working with Mr. Cross and Scotland Yard, though the case may be closed, our hearts never are, which is why I am happy to say that the Brockhollow Estate will be gifting a sum in excess of 150,000 pounds to the Anglican Church, and specifically to Our Lady of Prayerful Paws.


Brennan: And here this enormous sum of money goes up, and you see that Constance stands up and says,


Constance: Father, you must read the thank you from the cardinal.


Brennan: And he says,


Squire Brockhollow: No no, no no, there will be no praise for me, it is too small a sum, if any. Please, Constance, put it away.


Brennan: You see that he looks out and says,


Squire Brockhollow: So we are here to celebrate, instead, the coming of a new day where good works may be done in the parish and all of our proud subjects of the crown kept safe. Please, drink, eat and be merry, and enormous thanks to the Vicar Ian Prescott, for blessing us with his presence here at Loam Hall.


Sylvester: Yes, and if I may, while everyone, while we have your attention here, I would just like to say, though I never guarantee results in my cases, here in front of all of you, and you from the press, I should like to offer my fee back to the squire. I was not able to produce results, and so to you, I say, this call is social, not business. Your fee, sir.


Brennan: You hand it back. Give me a persuasion check with advantage, Mr. Cross, 'cause you're literally putting your money where your mouth is.


Grant: 17.


Brennan: 17. A round of applause goes up, Sylvester.


[all clapping]


Sylvester: Thank you, yes, thank you, I know.


Ally: Can I make an intimidate check as I walk the money from Sylvester to him, to add to that persuasion?


Brennan: Yeah, well actually, let's do this as a help action. Although, no, you already have advantage, so you can't get double advantage, but yeah, go ahead and give me an intimidate check, Lars.


Ally: Okay, that is a… Just an 11.


Brennan: Cool. You strut-


Ally: I trip. Ow!


Brennan: Squire Badger is an old military soul, he doesn't get rattled very easily, but you see he takes it, and you see that that 17 is high, Sylvester, but it's not high enough for Squire Badger. You look over and see Lawrence Longfoot, that newspaper magnate, raise a glass to you, and Squire Badger glares at you from the dais as you return your fee. What I would like is this, now, actually. Everyone here, give me a perception check. Let me know if you roll above a 15.


Sam: Hot damn.


Katie: No, only a 13.


Ally: 14.


Sam: 23.


Katie: Ooh!


Raph: Woo!


Brennan: 23.


Grant: 13.


Brennan: 13 from Sylvester, cool. So you notice something, Buckster. You see that Lawrence Longfoot takes out a camera with a bulb, and instead of taking the thing of Squire Badger's emoluments, Squire Badger's not a celebrity, so he takes a photo with Sylvester in the foreground like raising his glass, and Squire Badger in the background. Also, you beat a 20, so you also see, boom, the glass shatters, there is a moment of dark. In that moment of dark, you see that Mr. Gilfoyle, the butler, is just kind of like gone after that flash of light, and you also see there's, you know, like the light, there's a huge,


Attendees: Hooray!


Brennan: As Lawrence Longfoot says that. You think you see maybe a shape through the windows out in the rain, but you see that no one else noticed it. The reason no one else notices this is that as the light goes off, Mrs. Molesly the mole, the light goes off and she [yelps] just like bright light to a mole, just like drops a tray. Her head, it's like you can almost see things going over her head. And you see that this beautiful Lady Calliope, who is this beautiful deer, you see that she has a beautiful gown, like patron of the arts, stately pair of antlers coming off of her head, leans down and says,


Calliope: Oh my dear madam, please do stand,


Brennan: And lifts up Mrs. Molesly, who like is still out of it, and I'll tell you this. Grant, 13 is not high enough to notice all the stuff Buckster just noticed, but it is high enough for you to look out as someone says,


Attendee: Three cheers for the absolute class of the Hunter of Hampstead Street, Sylvester Cross!


Brennan: You see,


Attendees: Hip hip, hooray!


Brennan: As the three cheers go up, you look over across a crowded room, and see Daisy D'umpstaire. Hey, Rekha, is Daisy joining in in the three cheers?


Rekha: Absolutely not, she's got her arms crossed and she's sipping her own cocktail, and she doesn’t cheer- she downs it.


Brennan: Sylvester, Daisy.


Grant: And then Sylvester downs his cocktail.


Rekha: Downing a cocktail, too, I'll have you know, there's ice and crap in there. Umbrella.


Ally: The straw, yeah.


Lars:  Are we downing everything? I just start chugging my beers.


Daisy: Ugh, Germans.


Brennan: You both down your cocktails, make eye contact. Who is the first to break eye contact, if anyone, in this moment?


Rekha: I think I do, I think I break eye contact and leave-


Grant: It's not me, it's not me.


Rekha: I leave the room, yeah.


Brennan: You leave the room.


Grant: [hand over his heart] Ugh.


Ally: Brutal.


Brennan: Sylvester, you are whisked away, way, way back, many years ago. This is October 4th, 1905. We return all the way to 1893, to a younger-


Sam: Just got chills, y'all.


Brennan: To a younger, happier Sylvester, on the day he met Daisy D'umpstaire. And that's all for this episode of "Mice and Murder"!


Grant: Oh, no! Oh no, he's so sad!


Ally: I know all about it.


Grant: It's gonna make him so sad!


[NEXT EPISODE - Episode 2: A Scandal in Britannia]


[NEXT TIME ON DIMENSION 20]


Brennan: I invite you to a locomotive, 12 years prior to a as yet uninjured 43 year old Sylvester Cross. You look over and see a snarling jackal. This is the man you've been following. He tucks a stolen diadem into his coat. Daisy has just found her mark.


Unknown Speaker: What do you want, lady? Do I know you?


Daisy: You're about to.


Grant: My match strikes.


Brennan: Something has thrown Daisy off her game here.


Rekha: I think I'm in the presence of a hottie, and I don't think she knows what to do.


Brennan: This hot and heavy tension, caught in this moment, is only interrupted by the noise of, blam! Down the hallway, as the door to Daisy's room is kicked in and a gunshot goes off, boom. Both of you are slick enough to know exactly whose room that was.
